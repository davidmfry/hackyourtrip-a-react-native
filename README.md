# API Session Notes
## City Builder API
- 11 cities
- Improve cross border spend
- For merchants to increase visibility and drive revenue as a benefit for accepting
- Combat low cardholder awareness/usage and drive top of wallet behavior.
- ASsist cardmembers to engage with leading merchants at top tourist destinations. 

## How are merchants selected?
- Top TripAdvisor data
- Internal transaction data, mystery shopping.
- DCI Travel Tools Featured.

## Pain Points?
- Only 11 cities, pretty basic. Sorted by category (restaurants, hotels) - only 5 categories. 
- How can we create a better user experience?
- What other API's can we leverage?
- How can we launch more cities faster?
- TripAdvisor seems to be a hot topic.
- How can we create incremental value? Booking site? Reviews? Etc.
- Info available:
- No Merchant Ratings :(
    - Privilidges have a 5 star rating option.
- Icons with club member privilidges. 


# ATMs are a green money icon, and blue for privilidges, purple for the city guide items. 

# How to take it to the next level?
- We have the answer ;)
- Investment as a Privilidge :)
- Add a 'Business' Privilidge. Add the 6th privilidge. 

The real interesting API is the merchants, obviously. 

- hasPrivilidges param will let you return only merchants with privilidges. 
merchant_category will return those


# Priviledges
- Access to special DC card member offers
- Unique and valuable benefits

- Microfinancing purchases at a lounge. 
- Their app is brrroooookeeeen
- Meetup integration WOULD BE HUGE!
- Entertainment events include things like the opera.
